## Specification
The system must log data from a [u-blox MAX-M8Q][GPS] breakout board
and save it to an SD card. Further development is possible, but at
present the requirements are limited due to radio interference issues
in the past.

## FAQ

### Where does the name come from?
According to urban legend, cockroaches will outlive
us all, even through a nuclear apocalypse. This system
should be able to as well.
